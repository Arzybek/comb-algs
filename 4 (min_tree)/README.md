* Construct a minimal connecting tree of a given set of points on a plane in a rectangular metric (d (M, N) = | XM-XN | + | YM-YN |).
* Boruvka-Kruskal algorithm
* File input (in.txt):
* The set of points on the plane, given by pairs of coordinates (x, y).
  N is the number of points. Further, line by line the coordinates of the points.
* Output file (out.txt):
* The minimum spanning tree, specified as adjacency lists.
For each point of the original set, indicate the ordinal numbers of points adjacent to it. Start the list on a new line, order the points inside the list in ascending order of numbers. Each list ends with 0. In the last write the weight on a line of the file.
