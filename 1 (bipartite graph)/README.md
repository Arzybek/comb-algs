* Determine if the given connected undirected graph is bipartite.
* Using Breadth First Search
* Source data file (in.txt): 
* A graph defined by adjacency lists.
* N is the number of vertices in the graph.
* Further, the adjacency lists for each vertex are sequentially located. The list ends with 0.
* Result file (out.txt):
* If the graph is not bipartite, then "N" is written to the results file, otherwise "Y" and then the vertices included in the parts of the graph. Vertices in beats are sorted in ascending order of numbers. The first part to be printed is the part of which the vertex with the minimum number is included. The shares are separated by zero and each is printed on a new line.
